\q
\b
\v 1 With a determination to achieve the highest aim
\q1 For the benefit of all sentient beings
\q1 Which surpasses even the wish-fulfilling gem,
\q1 May I hold them dear at all times.
\q
\b
\v 2 Whenever I interact with someone,
\q1 May I view myself as the lowest amongst all,
\q1 And, from the very depths of my heart,
\q1 Respectfully hold others as superior.
\q
\b
\v 3 In all my deeds may I probe into my mind,
\q1 And as soon as mental and emotional afflictions arise-
\q1 As they endanger myself and others-
\q1 May I strongly confront them and avert them.
\q
\b
\v 4 When I see beings of unpleasant character
\q1 Oppressed by strong negativity and suffering,
\q1 May I hold them dear-for they are rare to find-
\q1 As if I have discovered a jewel treasure!
\q
\b
\v 5 When others, out of jealousy
\q1 Treat me wrongly with abuse, slander, and scorn,
\q1 May I take upon myself the defeat
\q1 And offer to others the victory.
\q
\b
\v 6 When someone whom I have helped,
\q1 Or in whom I have placed great hopes,
\q1 Mistreats me in extremely hurtful ways,
\q1 May I regard him still as my precious teacher.
\q
\b
\v 7 In brief, may I offer benefit and joy
\q1 To all my mothers, both directly and indirectly,
\q1 May I quietly take upon myself
\q1 All hurts and pains of my mothers.
\q
\b
\v 8 May all this remain undefiled
\q1 By the stains of the eight mundane concerns;
\q1 And may I, recognizing all things as illusion,
\q1 Devoid of clinging, be released from bondage.
